# WordleTypeGame
A game inspired by wordle that returns the amount of stars(correct positions) and planets(correct letters out of position). This code also selects a word randomly using headerfiles and directories. You will need to edit the WORDFILE parameter to be the path to the directory that contains the word file used for comparison. 

Attached is a ~72k word file that was used during development. Feel free to add words as you wish. Be wary not to include more than 8000 words or words larger than 6 characters or less that 4 since this program does not handle these cases.
